# This folder contains the implementation of an Embedded System's Layers, drivers, and interfaces. 
This Project aims at testing several **Embedded Systems Programming** concepts learned for **ATmega32**.
## It is divided in to 4 main layers and 1 helper folder:
 * Application Layer: Should contain the application to be tested
 * ECUAL: Electronic Unit Abstraction Layer, contains interfacing components codes.
 * MCAL: Microcontroller Abstraction Layer, contians drivers for the microcontroller.
 * MC: Contains Microcontroller related files.
 * Utilities: Contains extra defining files.
